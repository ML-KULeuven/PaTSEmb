Welcome to ``PaTSEmb``, a fast and extendable Python package for creating a pattern-based embedding
of the time series. This is an embedding of the time series which contains information
about the typical shapes are occurring at which locations in the time series. 
Below, we give a small example of how to do this, but be sure to check out the 
[documentation](https://PaTSEmb.readthedocs.io/)!

## Installation

You can install ``PaTSEmb`` using the following command:
```
pip install patsemb
```
If you want to mine frequent, sequential patterns, Java 1.7 or higher should also be 
available on your machine. More information about installing ``PaTSEmb`` can be found 
in the [documentation](https://patsemb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

## Example 

The code snippet below shows how to create the pattern-based embedding of a 
time series. Be sure to check out the [example notebook](notebooks/examples) 
for more examples!

```python
from patsemb.discretization import SAXDiscretizer
from patsemb.pattern_mining import QCSP
from patsemb.pattern_based_embedding import PatternBasedEmbedder

# Specify a discretizer and pattern miner, or use the default values
pattern_based_embedder = PatternBasedEmbedder(
    discretizer=SAXDiscretizer(alphabet_size=8, word_size=5),
    pattern_miner=QCSP(minimum_support=3, top_k_patterns=20)
)

# Create the pattern-based embedding
time_series = ...  # Load here your time series as a numpy array
embedding = pattern_based_embedder.fit_transform(time_series)
```
